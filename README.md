## Project Summary and Vision
Our vision is to provide an organized and user-friendly solution that helps people efficiently manage their responsibilities.

For busy individuals or individuals who find it hard to stay on top of their tasks, our chore-tracking application is designed to make managing tasks and responsibilities effortless and organized. It enables individuals to stay on top of their chores, providing a clear view of what needs to be done.
 
Our application is user-friendly, customizable, and adaptable to individual needs and preferences, ensuring a stress-free and productive lifestyle for all users. With real-time notifications, the app makes sure you are always on top of your chores, and never miss an important task again.

With the ability to create tasks on the go, you will never have to worry about forgetting to do something again, or having to rely on your memory to remember what needs to be done. Whether you're at home, on the go, or out running errands, you can easily create new tasks and add them to your to-do list. With our application, all your tasks are stored in one central location, accessible from any device with internet access.

We want our application to be a vehicle for behavior change. Many people find it difficult to plan their responsibilities effectively. Hence, the criteria of success for this project will hinge on its aptness to motivate whilst keeping the user accountable. The project will be judged as successful if over 75% of users report an increase in productivity over a period of one week.
